                  <h3><span class="number">01</span>THE ORIGIN</h3>
                  <p>It has become a trend for companies to develop products
                    that hold health benefits to meet the demands of consumers
                    on this aspect. Since May 2019, the brewery
                    group <span class="bold">Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev)</span>
                    – well known for creating <span class="bold">Budweiser</span> and other beers,
                    had been developing on a product that focused on features
                    which revolved around consumers’ health. The idea was to create
                    a beer that would make people gargle and enjoyed at the same time.
                    One of the proposals stood out, which was
                    to create a product, that combined of fresh beer and a product that
                    worked as good as a mouth lozenge.</p>

                  <h3><span class="number">02</span>THE PROCESS</h3>
                  <p>Several approaches were adapted into reality, but every one
                    of them ended up with a bad result. It was recognized that
                    a new approach and a corporation between <span class="bold">AB InBev</span> and
                    a well-known company which focuses on oral care products
                    must be established. After a careful consideration
                    and a prolonged researching process, <span class="bold">AB InBev</span> had
                    finally formed an outstandingly suitable partnership
                    with <span class="bold">Therabreath</span> – a brand of oral care products
                    headquartered in Los Angeles, California.</p>

                  <h3><span class="number">03</span>THE PARTNERSHIP</h3>
                  <p>Two companies had decided to come together and work
                    on a new beer product that would treat issues related
                    to halitosis – also known as bad breath, a symptom in
                    which a noticeably unpleasant breath odor is present.
                    It did not take long for both companies to conduct a
                    detailed research and developed several possible products
                    as experiments. In January 2020, it was finalized that two
                    companies had come up with a beer on the market that would
                    cure halitosis and bring oral care benefits to consumers.</p>

                  <p>In January 2020, <span class="bold">Therabreath Beer</span> was released and became a huge
                    success on the beer market. <span class="bold">Therabreath Beer</span> has several flavours,
                    which all leave different unique tastes,
                    but also maintain the slight bitterness and much sweeter
                    of Budweiser’s well-known flavor. The release of <span class="bold">Therabreath Beer</span>
                    also marks the first event in the history of the brewing
                    industry of having a beer that focuses on oral health.</p>
